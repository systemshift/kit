# Kit

**A Kernel-Oriented Git for Ultra-Efficient Storage and Intelligent Monorepo Management**

## Vision
Kit reimagines version control from first principles by integrating recent advances in machine learning—particularly kernel methods, feature extraction, and neural compression—to address the challenges of managing large files and monorepos.

## Core Principles
- **Kernelized Hashing**: Perform sublinear-time repository integrity checks without reconstructing full commit histories.
- **Advanced Compression**: Use ML-driven compression techniques to minimize storage requirements for large binary files.
- **Feature-Based Addressing**: Efficient retrieval and management of files based on their semantic features rather than explicit paths.

## Features
- **Semantic Versioning**: Track meaningful changes through embedding-based feature extraction.
- **Kernel Hashing**: Rapid integrity checks via kernelized hash computations.
- **ML-Powered Merge**: Intelligent conflict resolution guided by machine learning models.
- **Optimized Storage**: Significant storage reduction using advanced compression and feature encoding.

## Components
- **Kernelized Integrity Checks**: Validate repository integrity without costly full-state computations.
- **Differentiable Diffs**: Represent changes as differentiable functions enabling intelligent merges and storage efficiency.
- **Semantic Queries**: Retrieve data and history using semantic search and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH).

## Getting Started
_(Theoretical model—implementation not yet available)_

1. **Explore Kernel Methods**: Research and prototype kernel-based hashing and compression methods.
2. **Semantic Embeddings**: Design efficient embedding extraction methods for various file types.
3. **System Architecture**: Define a modular architecture supporting kernelized hashing, semantic versioning, and intelligent merging.

# Kit Technical Specifications

## Overview
Kit is a kernel-oriented Git-inspired version control system leveraging advanced machine learning techniques—particularly kernel methods—for efficient storage, fast verification, intelligent merging, and semantic monorepo management.

---

## Goals
- Highly efficient storage (especially large files)
- Rapid, sublinear-time integrity verification
- Intelligent diffing and merging using semantic context
- Semantic addressing and retrieval in large monorepos

---

## Core Components

### 1. Integrity Kernel
- **Kernel Method:** Random Fourier Features (RFF)
- **Purpose:** Rapid integrity checks without full history reconstruction
- **Implementation:**
  - Approximate RBF kernel efficiently
  - Compute compact hashes of repository states

### 2. Semantic Kernel
- **Kernel Method:** Cosine Similarity
- **Purpose:** Semantic diffing, merging, conflict resolution
- **Implementation:**
  - Embed source code (e.g., AST embeddings)
  - Compute semantic differences between embeddings

### 3. Retrieval Kernel
- **Kernel Method:** MinHash & Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
- **Purpose:** Efficient semantic retrieval within monorepos
- **Implementation:**
  - Compute MinHash signatures for file contents
  - Use LSH for fast approximate nearest neighbor searches

### 4. Compression Kernel
- **Kernel Method:** Kernel PCA or Autoencoder-based
- **Purpose:** Highly compressed, efficient semantic storage
- **Implementation:**
  - Generate embeddings to compress and store file contents
  - Efficient reconstruction when retrieving data

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Go (core, CLI, kernels)
- **Math Libraries:** Gonum, Gorgonia (optional for numerical efficiency)
- **Storage:** Custom storage engine (no external DB dependencies)
- **ML Prototyping:** Entirely in Go (no external Python dependencies)

---

## Kernel Design Considerations
- Ensure positive definiteness (Mercer’s theorem compliance)
- Computational efficiency (aim for sublinear complexity)
- Semantic relevance (accurately reflect semantic similarity)
- Stability (robustness to small changes)

### Custom Kernel Verification
- Generate and validate Gram matrices
- Use eigenvalue analysis to ensure positive definiteness

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Prototype Kernels
- Validate kernels mathematically and experimentally in Go

### Phase 2: Core System Development
- Implement kernels and core functionalities in Go
- Develop custom storage and semantic indexing system

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- Integrate kernels into storage, integrity checks, and retrieval system
- Comprehensive benchmarking and optimization

## Usage Example (Future CLI)
```bash
kit init
kit add .
kit commit -m "Initial commit"
kit verify --fast
kit merge branch --semantic
kit find "authentication module"
```

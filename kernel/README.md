# Kit Kernel Implementations

This directory contains prototype implementations of the four core kernels that form the foundation of Kit's approach to version control.

## Overview

Each kernel addresses a specific aspect of version control systems using techniques from machine learning and kernel methods:

1. **Integrity Kernel** - For fast repository verification
2. **Semantic Kernel** - For meaning-based code comparison
3. **Retrieval Kernel** - For efficient similarity search
4. **Compression Kernel** - For advanced content storage

## Implementation Details

### Integrity Kernel (`integrity.go`)

- **Algorithm**: Random Fourier Features (RFF) to approximate the RBF kernel
- **Purpose**: Sublinear-time repository integrity checking
- **Key Methods**:
  - `ComputeHash()` - Generates a compact hash representation of repository data
  - `VerifyIntegrity()` - Checks if two repository states are similar
- **Mathematical Basis**: Approximates exp(-γ||x-y||²) with random projections

### Semantic Kernel (`semantic.go`)

- **Algorithm**: Cosine similarity on code embeddings
- **Purpose**: Detect semantic similarity between code snippets
- **Key Methods**:
  - `SemanticDiff()` - Compute semantic difference between code
  - `SemanticMerge()` - Merge code based on semantic understanding
- **Mathematical Basis**: Cosine similarity on vector embeddings

### Retrieval Kernel (`retrieval.go`)

- **Algorithm**: MinHash and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
- **Purpose**: Efficiently find similar code across repositories
- **Key Methods**:
  - `MinHash()` - Compute MinHash signatures for documents
  - `LSHSignature()` - Generate LSH buckets for fast retrieval
  - `AreLikelySimilar()` - Quickly determine if two codes may be similar
- **Mathematical Basis**: Approximates Jaccard similarity with probabilistic guarantees

### Compression Kernel (`compression.go`)

- **Algorithm**: Kernel PCA with quantization
- **Purpose**: Efficient semantic-aware storage
- **Key Methods**:
  - `Compress()` - Compress data using kernel PCA projections
  - `Decompress()` - Reconstruct approximate original data
- **Mathematical Basis**: Kernel Principal Component Analysis with dimensionality reduction

## Usage

All kernels follow a similar pattern:

1. **Initialize** the kernel with appropriate parameters
2. **Process** input data to generate kernel-specific representations
3. **Compare** or **manipulate** these representations efficiently

See `example.go` in the project root for demonstrations of each kernel.

## Limitations

These implementations are prototypes to demonstrate the concepts:

- They use simplified data structures and algorithms
- Feature extraction is minimal and not production-ready
- Error handling is basic
- No persistence or optimization

A full implementation would require more sophisticated feature extraction, better optimization, and integration with a complete version control system.

## Further Development

See `roadmap.md` in the project root for the planned development path.
